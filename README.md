In Shell, We have multiple shells , Out of that we are going with BASH.

BASH = SH + KSH + CSH (On server side BASH is default)
ZSH (Too much modern, But most on Desktop env, Not on server)

1. She-Bang & Comments

3. Variables 
4. Take Inputs 
5. Functions
6. Redirectors, Quotes, Exit States
7. Conditions

#! is called as She-bang , It denotes path of interpreter. Also ensures the code that is present in the file executes with that interpreter. It has to be in the very first line
